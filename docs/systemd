#In the folder /etc/systemd/system/ make a file named screen.service
#The contents of that file might look like this (change for your use):

[Unit]

Description=Launches echobaseppp/main.py

After=network.target

[Service]

Type=simple

ExecStart=~/echobaseppp/main.py

RemainAfterExit=true

[Install]

WantedBy=multi-user.target

# When you're finished run systemctl enable screen.service, the WantedBy line tells systemd where to make the symlink.
