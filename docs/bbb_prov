=BBB image prep guide for ppp + echobaseapp=

-------------
Start with a fresh OEM board or fresh flash (with BBB-eMMC-flasher-2013.09.12.img.xz)
Remove some crap
-	opkg --force-depends remove gnome* 
-	opkg --force-depends remove avahi*
-	opkg --force-depends remove node*

or all at once since it will take ~30 minutes opkg --force-depends remove gnome* && opkg --force-depends remove avahi* && opkg --force-depends remove node*
-------------

Remove connman, as it really screws with network settings that we try to set manually. This requires removing connman packages and setting up 

/etc/network/interfaces FIRST to enable network access after reboot

DO THIS BEFORE REMOVING CONNMAN (unless you have serial port access)
Create /etc/network/interfaces with the following contents
---
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 10.10.10.138
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 10.10.10.1
---
Create a file to bring up eth0 on boot using systemd

/etc/systemd/system/net.service needs to contain: 
---
[Unit]
Description=Network interfaces
Wants=network.target
Before=network.target
BindsTo=sys-subsystem-net-devices-eth0.device
#After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlan0.device

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "sleep 5;ifup eth0"
ExecStop=/bin/sh -c "ifdown eth0"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
---

enable it with 
systemctl enable net.service

Now after that is setup, remove connman

-	opkg --force-depends --force-remove remove connman* 
-       you will have to reboot via serial or by pulling the power now to regain ssh access

-------------

Set runtime to be multi-user instead of graphical-user to disable X windows service launching 
-	ln -sf /lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target /etc/systemd/system/default.target (reboot after this)
-	reboot

-------------
Setup the DNS server for the system with:
echo "nameserver 8.8.4.4" > /etc/resolv.conf
-------------

-------------
Update packages and install BBIO library, pppd, etc
-       always set the time before working with opkg or pip (BBB does not have hardware RTC so with each boot run ntpdate pool.ntp.org (add to crontab with 

@reboot if you wish)
-	opkg update 
- 	opkg install python-pip python-setuptools python-smbus pyserial
-	pip install Adafruit_BBIO

-------------

install ppp and scripts

opkg install ppp

set default gateway to ppp connection, to allow for IP address changes to appserver05.cphandheld.com
Before final deployment this image should be further inspected for unnecessary traffic

add this to /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/01setuproute

route add default dev ppp0


Before final deployment, remove the default route entry in /etc/network/interfaces to avoid conflict and a route will not be required in the field for 

ethernet debugging (although I suggest field debugging over serial)

Add startup scripts, make sure they have the option "After=network.target" (they currently do) removed or they will NOT start without a network cable 

plugged in

Modify startup scripts for capitalizaton in paths (noticed latest code has captialized folders)
Desktop  EchoBasePPP  ModemScripts  RfScripts  pppd  systemd

You can monitor traffic flowing through the ppp0 connection by taxing the traffic counter with ifconfig ppp0
